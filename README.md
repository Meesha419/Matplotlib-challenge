• From the selected treatments Capomulin and Ramicane reduces the size of tumors better.
• The correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume a strong positive correlation,

• The bar-graph shows the Drug Regimen Capomulin has the maximum number of mice (230), and Zoniferol has the minimum number of mice (182).
